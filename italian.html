                <h3>Preparation :</h3>
                <h4>1. Cook the Spaghetti
                    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.
                    Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the spaghetti. Set aside.</h4>
                    <h4>
                        2. Make the Tomato Sauce
                            Heat olive oil in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat.
                            Add the chopped onion and saut√© until translucent, about 3‚Äì4 minutes.
                            Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another 1 minute until fragrant.
                            Pour in the crushed tomatoes or tomato puree. Stir to combine.
                            Add sugar (if needed), oregano, chili flakes, salt, and pepper. Let the sauce simmer gently for 10‚Äì15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly.
                            Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

                    <h4>
                        3. Combine Pasta and Sauce
                        Add the cooked spaghetti directly to the sauce in the skillet.
                        Toss well to coat the spaghetti evenly with the sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta cooking water to loosen it.
                        </h4>
                    <h4>4. Serve
                        Divide the spaghetti into serving plates or bowls.
                        Garnish with fresh basil leaves and sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese on top.
                        Serve immediately with a side of crusty bread or garlic bread if desired.

                        Tips for Perfect Spaghetti :
                             Pasta Water: The starchy water enhances the sauce's consistency and helps it cling to the pasta.

                <h3>Preparation :</h3>
                <h4>1. Cook the Rice
                    In a medium saucepan, bring the broth to a boil. Add the rice, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed (about 18‚Äì20 minutes).
                    Stir in butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and black pepper. Mix until creamy.
                    Spread the rice on a baking sheet to cool completely.</h4>
                 <!-- <h4>   2. Cook the Rice
                    In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt.
                    Add the soaked rice and cook until it is 70% cooked (it should still be firm). Drain and set aside.</h4> -->
                   <h4> 2. Prepare the Filling
                    If using ground meat or vegetables, cook and season them as desired. Let cool.
                    Cut mozzarella into small cubes, about 1/2 inch each.
                    </h4>
                 <h4>   3. Assemble the Arancini
                    Scoop about 2 tablespoons of rice into your hand and flatten it into a disc.
                    Place a piece of mozzarella (and a small spoonful of filling, if using) in the center.
                    Mold the rice around the filling, shaping it into a ball. Repeat with remaining rice and filling. </h4>
                   <h4> 4. Bread the Rice Balls
                    Roll each rice ball in flour, shaking off excess.
                    Dip it into the beaten eggs, ensuring it is fully coated.
                    Roll it in breadcrumbs, pressing gently to ensure the coating sticks. </h4>
                 <h4>   5. Fry the Arancini
                    Heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil in a deep pot or skillet over medium heat. The oil should reach 350¬∞F (175¬∞C).
                    Fry the arancini in batches, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crispy (about 3‚Äì4 minutes).
                    Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
