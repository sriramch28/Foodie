                <h3>Preparation :</h3>
                <h4>1. Prepare the Meat Filling
                    Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
                    Add chopped onion and saut√© until translucent (about 2 minutes).
                    Stir in minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds until fragrant.
                    Add the ground meat and cook until browned, breaking it into smaller pieces with a spatula.
                    Sprinkle in chili powder, paprika, cumin, oregano, salt, and pepper. Mix well.
                    Stir in the tomato sauce or salsa and simmer for 5 minutes until the mixture is well-coated and slightly thickened.
                    Remove from heat and set aside.</h4>
                    <h4>
                    2. Prepare the Tortillas
                    Heat a dry skillet over medium heat.
                    Warm each tortilla for about 30 seconds per side, until soft and pliable.
                    Optional: For crispy taco shells, fold tortillas in half and fry in hot oil until golden..</h4>
                    <h4>3. Assemble the Tacos
                        Lay a warm tortilla flat on a plate.
                        Add a generous spoonful of the meat filling to the center.
                        Top with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, and shredded cheese.
                        Add a dollop of sour cream and guacamole.
                        Sprinkle with chopped cilantro and add jalape√±os for extra spice.
                        </h4>
                    <h4>4. Serve
                        Serve immediately with lime wedges for squeezing over the tacos.
                        Pair with Mexican rice, refried beans, or tortilla chips for a complete meal.
                        
                    </h4>
                    <h4>5.Customizable Fillings: Swap the meat for grilled shrimp, fish, or saut√©ed vegetables for different variations.
                Crispy vs. Soft: Decide if you prefer soft tortillas or crunchy taco shells. Both work wonderfully!</h4>
            <h4> Make Ahead: You can prepare the meat filling ahead of time and reheat it when needed.</h4>

                <h3>Preparation :</h3>
                <h4>1. Prepare the Base
                    Preheat your oven to 375¬∞F (190¬∞C).
                    Spread a layer of tortilla chips evenly on a large baking sheet or oven-safe platter.</h4>
                 <!-- <h4>   2. Cook the Rice
                    In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt.
                    Add the soaked rice and cook until it is 70% cooked (it should still be firm). Drain and set aside.</h4> -->
                   <h4>2. Add Cheese and Toppings
                    Sprinkle shredded cheese generously over the tortilla chips.
                    Add your preferred toppings such as cooked meat, beans, tomatoes, jalape√±os, olives, corn, and onions.
                    Sprinkle with fresh cilantro and serve with lime wedges on the side.
                </h4>
                 <h4>  3. Bake the Nachos 
                    Place the prepared nachos in the preheated oven.
                    Bake for 8‚Äì10 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
                    </h4>
                   <h4>4. Garnish and Serve
                    Remove the nachos from the oven and let them cool slightly.
                    Add dollops of sour cream, guacamole, and salsa on top.
                 Sprinkle with fresh cilantro and serve with lime wedges on the side.
                </h4>
                     
                 <h4>   Tips for Perfect Nachos : </h4>
                  <h4> 1. Layering: For even coverage, layer the chips and toppings instead of piling everything on top. </h4>
                  <h4> 2. Customizable: Add or remove toppings to suit your taste. </h4>
                <h4>  3. Crispy Chips: Avoid soggy nachos by adding wet toppings like salsa and sour cream after baking.</h4>
