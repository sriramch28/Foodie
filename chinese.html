                <h3>Preparation :</h3>
                <h4>1. Prepare the Filling
                    Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan or wok.
                    Add the ginger-garlic paste and saut√© until fragrant.
                    Add the shredded cabbage, carrots, bell peppers, and bean sprouts. Stir-fry on high heat for 2-3 minutes.
                    Add soy sauce, vinegar, black pepper, and salt. Mix well.
                    Stir-fry for another 1-2 minutes. The vegetables should remain slightly crunchy.
                    Remove from heat and let the filling cool completely.</h4>
                    <h4> Assemble the Spring Rolls
                        Place a spring roll wrapper on a flat surface with one corner pointing toward you (diamond shape).
                        Add about 2 tablespoons of the cooled filling near the center of the wrapper.
                        Fold the bottom corner over the filling, then fold in the left and right corners.
                        Roll it tightly toward the top corner, sealing the edge with the prepared flour paste.
                        Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling.</h4>
                    <h4>
                        3. Fry the Spring Rolls
                        Heat oil in a deep pan or wok on medium heat.
                        Fry the spring rolls in batches until they are golden brown and crispy.
                        Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
                        </h4>
                    <h4>4. Serve
                        Serve hot with sweet chili sauce, soy sauce, or any dipping sauce of your choice.

                <h3>Preparation :</h3>
                <h4>1. Marinate the Chicken
                    In a bowl, mix soy sauce, sesame oil, and cornstarch.
                    Add the chicken pieces and toss to coat. Set aside for 15-20 minutes.
                    </h4>
                 <!-- <h4>   2. Cook the Rice
                    In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt.
                    Add the soaked rice and cook until it is 70% cooked (it should still be firm). Drain and set aside.</h4> -->
                   <h4> 2. Prepare the Sauce
                    In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, hoisin sauce, dark soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, and cornstarch slurry. Mix well and set aside.
                    </h4>
                 <h4>   3. Stir-Fry the Chicken
                    Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat.
                    Add the marinated chicken and stir-fry until the pieces are browned and cooked through. Remove and set aside. </h4>
                   <h4> 4. Cook the Aromatics and Vegetables
                    Add the remaining oil to the wok. Toss in the dried red chilies and Sichuan peppercorns. Stir-fry for 30 seconds until fragrant.
                    Add the minced garlic and ginger. Stir quickly to avoid burning.
                    Add the bell peppers, zucchini, or celery and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until slightly tender but still crisp. </h4>
                 <h4>  5. Combine and Finish
                    Return the chicken to the wok and toss with the vegetables.
                    Pour the prepared sauce over the chicken and vegetables. Stir continuously until the sauce thickens and evenly coats everything.
                    <!-- Add the roasted peanuts and green onions. Stir well for another minute. -->
