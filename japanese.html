                <h3>Preparation :</h3>
                <h4>1. Cook and Season the Rice
                    Rinse the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear to remove excess starch.
                    Combine rice and water in a rice cooker or pot. Cook according to the rice cooker instructions or simmer on the stovetop for about 18 minutes, then let it rest for 10 minutes.
                    In a small saucepan, mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Heat gently until dissolved.
                    Transfer the cooked rice to a large bowl. Gradually fold in the vinegar mixture while fanning the rice to cool it. Set aside to cool completely.</h4>
                    <h4>2. Prepare the Ingredients
                        Slice fish and vegetables into thin, even strips.
                        Lay out your bamboo sushi mat and cover it with plastic wrap to prevent sticking.
                        </h4>
                    <h4>
                        3. Assemble the Sushi
                        Place a sheet of nori, shiny side down, on the bamboo mat.
                        Wet your hands with water to prevent rice from sticking. Spread a thin, even layer of sushi rice over the nori, leaving about 1 inch at the top edge.
                        In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt.
                        Arrange fish, vegetables, or other fillings horizontally across the rice, about 1 inch from the bottom edge.
                        </h4>
                    <h4>4. Roll the Sushi In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt.
                        Using the bamboo mat, lift the bottom edge of the nori and roll it tightly over the filling.
                        Press gently but firmly to shape the roll as you go. Continue rolling until you reach the top edge.
                        In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt.
                        Dab a little water on the top edge of the nori to seal the roll.
                        </h4>
                    <h4>5. Slice and Serve 
                        Use a sharp knife to cut the sushi roll into 6‚Äì8 even pieces. Wipe the knife with a damp cloth between cuts for clean slices.
                        Arrange the sushi on a plate and serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger on the side.

                <h3>Preparation :</h3>
                <h4>1. Prepare the Meat
                    If using chicken breasts, slice each breast horizontally into two thinner pieces. This ensures even cooking. For pork, choose cutlets that are about 1/2 inch thick or gently pound them to this thickness using a meat mallet.
                    Lightly season both sides of each piece with salt and black pepper. Let it rest for 5 minutes to absorb the seasoning.
                    </h4>
                 <!-- <h4>   2. Cook the Rice
                    In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt.
                    Add the soaked rice and cook until it is 70% cooked (it should still be firm). Drain and set aside.</h4> -->
                   <h4>2. Set Up Your Breading Station
                    Arrange three shallow bowls:
                    Bowl 1: Add the flour.
                    Bowl 2: Beat the eggs until smooth.
                    Bowl 3: Place the panko breadcrumbs.
                    Coat each piece of meat in the following order:
                    First, dredge it in flour, ensuring it‚Äôs lightly coated. Shake off the excess.
                    Second, dip it into the beaten eggs, covering all sides.
                    Third, press it into the panko breadcrumbs, ensuring an even, thick coating. Pat the breadcrumbs gently to make them stick well.
                   
                    .</h4>
                 <h4>  3. Heat the Oil
                    In a deep skillet or heavy-bottomed pan, pour in enough vegetable oil to cover the bottom to about 1 inch deep.
                    Heat the oil over medium heat until it reaches approximately 350¬∞F (175¬∞C). If you don‚Äôt have a thermometer, drop a breadcrumb into the oil; it should sizzle and float to the surface immediately. </h4>
                   <h4> 4. Fry the Katsu
                    Carefully place 1‚Äì2 cutlets in the hot oil. Avoid overcrowding the pan, which can lower the oil temperature and make the coating soggy.
                    Fry each piece for about 3‚Äì4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy.
                    Use tongs or a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked katsu to a wire rack or a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil. </h4>
                 <h4>  5. Make the Tonkatsu Sauce (Optional)
                    In a small bowl, combine ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and Dijon mustard. Stir until smooth.
                    Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. The sauce should be tangy, sweet, and slightly savory.
