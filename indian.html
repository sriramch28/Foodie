                <h3>Preparation :</h3>
                <h4>1. Marinate the Chicken
                    In a large bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, coriander powder, cumin powder, lemon juice, and salt.
                    Add the chicken pieces and coat them well with the marinade.
                    Cover and let it marinate for at least 1 hour (preferably overnight for better flavor).</h4>
                 <!-- <h4>   2. Cook the Rice
                    In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt.
                    Add the soaked rice and cook until it is 70% cooked (it should still be firm). Drain and set aside.</h4> -->
                   <h4> 2. Cook the Chicken
                    Heat oil or ghee in a large pan. Add sliced onions and saut√© until golden brown.
                    Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and mushy.
                    Add the marinated chicken and cook on medium heat until the chicken is fully cooked and the oil separates from the masala.</h4>
                 <h4>   3. Layer the Biryani
                    In a heavy-bottomed pot, spread half of the cooked rice.
                    Layer the chicken mixture evenly on top of the rice.
                    Add the remaining rice as the final layer.
                    Sprinkle mint, cilantro, garam masala, and saffron milk over the rice. Optionally, add fried onions for extra flavor. </h4>
                   <h4> 4. Dum Cooking (Steam Cooking)
                    Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. If the lid isn‚Äôt tight, seal the edges with dough or place a heavy weight on top.
                    Cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes. This allows the flavors to blend beautifully.
                    Turn off the heat and let it rest for 10 minutes before serving. </h4>
                 <h4>   5. Serve
                    Gently mix the layers to combine the rice and chicken.
                    Serve hot with raita, salad, or boiled eggs on the side.
